Program 1 - Credit Card Validator
This java code validates an 8- or 9-digit credit card number using a series of checks based on a modified version of the Luhn algorithm. It removes the last digit, reverses the remaining digits, doubles alternate digits, sums them, and compares the result to the original last digit to determine if the card is valid.

Program 2 - Alphabet War Game
This java code simulates a game where letters from two opposing sides (left and right) have assigned strengths, determining the outcome when words are compared. It supports default and custom letter strengths and allows for either single-word or two-word play modes. The game calculates scores based on letters present in each word and declares the side with the higher score as the winner.

Program 3 - Top K Frequent Numbers
This java code finds and prints the top K most frequently occurring numbers in an array provided by the user. It counts the occurrences of each number, sorts them based on frequency (and value if frequencies are tied), and outputs the K most frequent numbers. This approach uses a frequency array for counting and a 2D array for sorting by frequency and number.

Program 4 - Share Traders

It takes an array of stock prices as input, iterates through them to find two optimal buy-sell pairs, and then calculates the highest possible profit. This is achieved by keeping track of minimum prices and calculating potential profits on two passes through the data.
