Program 1 - Credit Card Validator
This Creditcard class validates an 8- or 9-digit credit card number using a series of checks based on a modified version of the Luhn algorithm. It removes the last digit, reverses the remaining digits, doubles alternate digits, sums them, and compares the result to the original last digit to determine if the card is valid.

Program 2 - Alphabet War Game
The AlphabetWarGame class simulates a game where letters from two opposing sides (left and right) have assigned strengths, determining the outcome when words are compared. It supports default and custom letter strengths and allows for either single-word or two-word play modes. The game calculates scores based on letters present in each word and declares the side with the higher score as the winner.
